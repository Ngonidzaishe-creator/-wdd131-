What is included:
- index.html
- destinations.html
- contact.html
- thankyou.html
- references.html
- styles/styles.css
- scripts/script.js

Important notes before submission:
1. Replace placeholder images in the images/ folder with real optimized images:
   - images/hero.jpg
   - images/mutarazi.jpg
   - images/greatzimbabwe.jpg
   - images/matobo.jpg
   - images/favicon.ico (optional)
2. Run Lighthouse in DevTools and fix any accessibility/performance issues you spot.
3. Ensure the GitHub Pages repository has this project in the correct subfolder and site is published.
4. All JS uses template literals for building HTML strings per project requirements.
5. If you want, I can also add a deploy-ready README with specific Git commands for pushing to GitHub.

How to use:
- Download the zip, extract into your wdd131 repository subfolder.
- Add your images into the images/ directory.
- Preview by opening index.html in a browser, or push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages for the repo/subfolder.
